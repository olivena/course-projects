Clouds drift across the sky, forming shapes that shift and dissolve in the wind. 
Some are thin and wispy like cirrus, stretched across the blue horizon. 
Others are thick and heavy, like cumulonimbus, towering high with the promise of rain. 
They move gracefully, painting the atmosphere with patterns of light and shadow, 
reminding us of the vastness above and the ever-changing nature of the world.
